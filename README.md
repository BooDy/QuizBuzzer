# QuizBuzzer
A little expressJS buzzer application we use in Mushtarak's quiz nights


Installation

clone the repository

npm install

npm start

Every team can open the URL you're serving the application at,
Enter their name and from the same screen the player can press the buzzer button.

The player who pressed the buzzer button first will appear on the URL /dashboard
with a countdown to show the time remaining before other players can try to 
answer the question.
